## Introduction to the Color Wheel Chart with HSL and YCbCr Display​
This interactive color wheel chart visualizes color relationships based on two color models: HSL and YCbCr. Alongside the color wheel, a luma chart provides insights into brightness levels.

The chart offers several controls to adjust both the appearance of the color wheel and the structure of the luma chart. Below is a detailed explanation of these controls and how they impact the display.

## Explanation of Controls​
- Wheel Radius:Adjusts the size of the color wheel. Increasing the radius enlarges the wheel, while reducing it makes the wheel smaller within the display.
- Saturation:Modifies the saturation of the colors in the wheel. A low value desaturates the colors to grayscale, while a higher value increases saturation, making the colors appear more vivid.
- Hue Delta:Changes the distribution of hues across the color wheel. Instead of evenly spreading the hues, this control allows you to shrink or expand specific hue regions, creating a visual effect resembling propeller-like blades on a vectorscope.
 Luma Steps:Defines the number of brightness steps in the luma chart. A higher number of steps creates a finer gradient of brightness levels, while fewer steps result in a more distinct, stepped gradient.
- Hue Pieces:Adjusts how many segments the color wheel is divided into. Increasing the number results in finer divisions with more color segments, while decreasing it makes the wheel appear with larger, broader color sections.
 
- Wheel Type:Allows you to select the color wheel model to display. Options include:
  
-- None: No color wheel.

-- YCbCr: Displays a color wheel based on the YCbCr color space, commonly used in video encoding.

-- HSL-120: Displays an HSL color wheel with hues offset by 120 degrees.

-- HSL: Displays a standard HSL color wheel.

- Ramp Type:Determines the type of gradient shown in the luma chart. The options include:
 
-- Black: A black background.

-- White: A white gradient.

-- Steps: A stepped luma chart with distinct brightness levels.

-- Smooth: A smooth luma gradient with continuous changes in brightness.
